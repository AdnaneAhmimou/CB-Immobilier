## Overview

CB Immobilier uses a refined, professional design system tailored for the real estate market. The base canvas is **pure white** (`{colors.canvas}` — #ffffff) with deep near-black ink (`{colors.ink}` — #222222) for headlines and body. The visual identity is defined by a sophisticated duo of **Navy** (`{colors.primary}` — #0F3C69) and **Emerald** (`{colors.secondary}` — #088F6D), drawn directly from the logo. Navy anchors the layout with trust and professionalism, while Emerald brings vitality to accents and interactive elements.

Type runs on modern, clean sans-serifs, prioritizing legibility and a premium feel. Display headlines are set at modest weights (500–600) to let high-quality property photography carry the visual heft, preventing the interface from feeling too heavy or enterprise-like.

The shape language is **approachable yet structured**. Buttons are 8px radius (`{rounded.sm}`), property cards are ~14px (`{rounded.md}`), and interactive icons are often fully rounded. The layout avoids overly sharp corners to maintain a welcoming consumer-facing experience.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Dual brand colors: `{colors.primary}` (#0F3C69 — Navy) and `{colors.secondary}` (#088F6D — Emerald). Navy is used for main CTAs and structural elements, while Emerald highlights badges, success states, and accents. A brand gradient seamlessly blends the two for special moments.
- Custom variable type: `Airbnb Cereal VF`. Display weights sit at 500–700, body at 400. Modest weight is intentional — the system trusts photography for visual heft.
- Three-product top nav: Homes, Experiences, Services — each with a hand-illustrated 32px icon and "NEW" badges (`{component.new-tag}`) on the two newer products. Active tab uses an underline rule (`{component.product-tab-active}`).
- Pill-shaped global search bar: white surface, fully rounded (`{rounded.full}`), divided by 1px hairlines into Where / When / Who segments, terminated by a circular Rausch search orb (`{component.search-orb}`).
- Property cards are photo-first: aspect-ratio rectangles with `{rounded.md}` corner clipping, swipeable image carousel, "Guest favorite" floating badge top-left, heart icon top-right, then 4–5 lines of meta beneath.
- Editorial dropdowns (footer, language picker) are clean text columns over the white canvas — no card surface, no shadow.
- The design system caps elevation at one shadow tier (`box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0 0 0 1px, rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0 2px 6px, rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 4px 8px`) — used on hover-floated cards and search/account dropdowns.
- 8px base spacing system, with major sections at `{spacing.section}` (64px) — generous but not airy enough to feel editorial-magazine; the marketplace density wants more cards per scroll.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Navy** (`{colors.primary}` — #0F3C69): The primary brand color. Inspired by the left half of the logo's roof and the 'C' in the text. Used for main CTA backgrounds, prominent UI elements, and headers. It establishes trust and reliability.
- **Navy Active** (`{colors.primary-active}` — #0A2846): The press / pointer-down variant for interactive states.
- **Emerald** (`{colors.secondary}` — #088F6D): The secondary brand color. Inspired by the right half of the logo's roof and the 'B'. Used for secondary buttons, success states, badges, and vibrant accents to draw attention.
- **Emerald Active** (`{colors.secondary-active}` — #05664D): The press / pointer-down variant for Emerald.
- **Brand Gradient** (`{colors.gradient}` — `linear-gradient(90deg, #0F3C69 0%, #088F6D 100%)`): Replicates the text gradient from the logo. Best used sparingly for special featured moments, hero text, or decorative borders.
- **Disabled** (`{colors.primary-disabled}` — #B3C2D1): A pale, low-contrast navy tint used on disabled CTAs.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — #ffffff): The default page floor for every public page. Clean, pure white to let property photography stand out.
- **Surface Soft** (`{colors.surface-soft}` — #f7f7f7): The lightest fill for disabled fields, sub-nav hover backgrounds, and inline filter bands.
- **Surface Strong** (`{colors.surface-strong}` — #f2f2f2): Slightly heavier fill for circular icon-button surfaces.

### Hairlines & Borders
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — #dddddd): The default 1px border tone — search bar dividers, table separators, card borders.
- **Hairline Soft** (`{colors.hairline-soft}` — #ebebeb): A lighter divider used on long-scrolling editorial separators.
- **Border Strong** (`{colors.border-strong}` — #c1c1c1): A heavier stroke used on disabled outline buttons and form input outlines after focus.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — #222222): The dominant text color on light surfaces, directly matching the "Immobilier" text from the logo. Used for display headlines, body paragraphs, and primary links.
- **Body** (`{colors.body}` — #3f3f3f): A secondary running-text color used for dense copy where pure ink would feel too heavy.
- **Muted** (`{colors.muted}` — #6a6a6a): Used for sub-titles, inactive labels, and secondary meta text.
- **Muted Soft** (`{colors.muted-soft}` — #929292): Disabled link text. Used very sparingly.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — #ffffff): White text over Navy or Emerald CTAs to ensure optimal contrast and readability.

### Semantic
- **Error** (`{colors.error-text}` — #c13515): Inline error text for form validation.
- **Error Hover** (`{colors.error-text-hover}` — #b32505): Darkens on link hover.
- **Success** (`{colors.success-text}` — #088F6D): Shares the Emerald brand tone, naturally suited for positive confirmations.

### Scrim
- **Scrim** (`{colors.scrim}` — #000000 at 50% opacity): The global modal backdrop tone — date picker, login dialog, language picker. Stored as the base hex; opacity is applied at render time.

## Typography

### Font Family
The system runs **Airbnb Cereal VF** for everything — display, body, navigation, captions, microcopy. Fallbacks walk `Circular, -apple-system, system-ui, Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif`. **Circular** is the historic in-house typeface still kept as the first non-variable fallback; system stacks back it up.

There is no separate display family. The variable font carries the entire scale.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.rating-display}` | 64px | 700 | 1.1 | -1px | Listing detail rating display ("4.81") |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 28px | 700 | 1.43 | 0 | Homepage h1 ("Inspiration for future getaways") |

| `{typography.nav-link}` | 16px | 600 | 1.25 | 0 | Top product-nav labels (Homes, Experiences, Services) |

### Principles
Display weights stay modest. The homepage h1 at 28px / 700 is deliberately small — it tucks under the search bar so photography and the city-link grid carry visual hierarchy. The listing-detail h1 at 22px / 500 is even quieter; the listing photo banner does the work above it.

The single typographically loud moment in the entire system is the **rating display** (`{typography.rating-display}` — 64px / 700) on listing pages. That is the only place the system trusts type alone to carry hierarchy — rating numbers are a peak trust signal, so they get the loudest treatment.

### Note on Font Substitutes
If Airbnb Cereal VF and Circular are unavailable, **Inter** is the closest open-source substitute. Adjust display headlines down by ~2% in line-height to match Cereal's slightly tighter cap height; otherwise the proportions transfer cleanly.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit:** 4px (with 2px micro-step).
- **Tokens:** `{spacing.xxs}` 2px · `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.base}` 16px · `{spacing.lg}` 24px · `{spacing.xl}` 32px · `{spacing.xxl}` 48px · `{spacing.section}` 64px.
- **Section padding (vertical):** `{spacing.section}` (64px) for major page bands; tighter than typical SaaS marketing (80–96px) because marketplace pages need higher card density per scroll.
- **Card internal padding:** `{spacing.lg}` (24px) for `{component.host-card}` and `{component.reservation-card}`; `{spacing.base}` (16px) for property-card meta block; `{spacing.sm}` (8px) for caption / date-row gutters.
- **Gutters:** `{spacing.base}` (16px) between cards in the homepage city grid; `{spacing.lg}` (24px) inside footer column gutters; `{spacing.xs}` (4px) on dense category-strip dividers.

### Grid & Container
- **Max content width:** ~1280px centered on the homepage and editorial pages. Listing detail pages cap closer to 1080px to keep the photo banner and reservation rail readable.
- **City link grid (homepage footer):** 6-column grid at desktop with each cell housing a city name in `{typography.title-md}` and a category sub-label in `{typography.body-sm}` muted.
- **Listing detail:** 2-column with photo / amenity body on the left (~64% width) and a sticky reservation card (`{component.reservation-card}`) on the right (~32%).
- **Footer:** 3-column link list (Support / Hosting / Airbnb) at desktop, collapsing to 1-column on mobile.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The system gives editorial bands 64px of vertical breathing room but compresses card grids — property and city-link cards sit just 16px apart. The contrast is intentional: the page reads as "open hero, dense marketplace below," reinforcing the marketplace nature without overwhelming the visitor at the fold.

## Elevation

The system has essentially **one shadow tier** plus the flat baseline.

- **Flat (no shadow):** Body, hero, footer, all editorial bands — 95% of surfaces.
- **Card hover float:** `box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02) 0 0 0 1px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04) 0 2px 6px 0, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0 4px 8px 0` — applied to property cards on pointer hover, the search bar at rest, and the dropdown menus (account menu, language picker, date picker). This is the single shadow definition in the entire system.
- **Modal scrim:** `{colors.scrim}` rendered at 50% opacity — the global modal backdrop. Used on date pickers, login dialogs, language picker.

There are no progressive elevation tiers — the system either has the one shadow or none. Depth comes from photography, the white-on-white surface separation, and rounded-corner clipping rather than from layered shadows.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — Navy fill, white text, 8px radius, 14×24px padding, 48px height, weight 500. The most common CTA across the system: "Search", "Contact", "Submit".

**`button-primary-active`** — The press state. Background flips to `{colors.primary-active}`. No transform, no shadow change.

**`button-primary-disabled`** — Pale Navy tint with white text. Cursor not-allowed.

**`button-secondary`** — White fill with ink text and a 1px ink outline. 8px radius. Used for inverse CTAs over Navy surfaces or secondary actions.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — Plain ink text, no surface, no border. Underlined on hover. Used for "Show more" type links and modal close labels.

**`button-pill-accent`** — A pill-shaped Emerald CTA used on featured cells — 9999px radius, 10×20px padding, 14px label.

### Search Surface

**`search-bar-pill`** — The signature global search bar. White fill, 9999px radius, 64px height, 1px hairline 1px-shadow border. Internally divided by vertical hairline rules into `{component.search-field-segment}` cells. Each segment holds an uppercase caption label above a placeholder line in `{typography.caption}`.

**`search-orb`** — The circular Navy orb terminating the right edge of the search bar. 48×48px, fully rounded, white magnifying-glass icon centered.

### Top Navigation

**`top-nav`** — White surface, 80px height, 1px bottom hairline. The Airbnb wordmark sits flush left, the three product tabs (Homes / Experiences / Services) sit in the dead center, and account utilities (host link, language globe, account menu) sit flush right.

**`product-tab-active`** — Ink label in `{typography.nav-link}`, 32px hand-illustrated icon, 2px ink underline rule beneath the icon-label pair.

**`product-tab-inactive`** — Muted label, illustrated icon, no underline. Becomes active on click.

**`new-tag`** — A tiny rounded-pill badge (`{rounded.full}`) anchored top-right of an icon, carrying the uppercase "NEW" label in `{typography.uppercase-tag}` (8px / 700 with 0.32px tracking, uppercase). Used on Experiences and Services to signal recency.

### Listing Cards

**`property-card`** — A photo-first card. 1:1 aspect-ratio image with `{rounded.md}` corner clipping, image carousel dots overlay, "Featured" floating badge top-left, and a heart icon top-right (`{component.icon-button-circle}` in default outlined state, Emerald-filled when saved). Beneath the image: 4–5 lines of meta — title (`{typography.title-md}`), location / dates (`{typography.body-sm}` muted), and price right-aligned.

**`property-card-photo`** — The photo plate itself, separated as a token because some surfaces (wishlist, search results) reuse just the photo without the meta block.

**`experience-card`** — A taller-aspect card (4:5) for experience listings. Same `{rounded.md}` clipping, floating "NEW" badge top-left, heart top-right, and a single-line title beneath.

**`guest-favorite-badge`** — White rounded pill (`{rounded.full}`) at 11px / 600 weight. Sits over the photo with the system's only shadow tier applied for elevation.

### Listing Detail

**`rating-display-card`** — The signature listing-detail moment. A 64px / 700 rating number ("4.81") flanked left and right by tiny laurel-wreath SVG ornaments. Beneath the rating: "Guest favorite" tagline and a row of ink stat columns. The largest typographic weight in the whole system.

**`amenity-row`** — A 1-column list of amenity icons + ink labels in `{typography.body-md}`. 12px row padding, no border between rows; section is closed by a 1px hairline divider above and below.

**`reviews-card`** — A 2-column grid of review excerpts. Each column holds an author row (avatar, name, date) above a 3-line excerpt with "Show more" tertiary link.

**`host-card`** — A white card with `{rounded.md}` rounding and 24px padding holding a host avatar, name, "Superhost" badge, response-rate stat, and a "Contact host" `{component.button-secondary}`.

**`reservation-card`** — The sticky right-rail card on listing detail pages. White surface, `{rounded.md}` rounding, 1px hairline border, 1px shadow tier elevation, 24px padding. Contains: nightly price (`{typography.display-md}` ink), date-range selector, guest-count stepper, "Reserve" primary CTA full-width, and a fee breakdown stack beneath in `{typography.body-sm}`.

### Date Picker

**`date-picker-day`** — A 40×40px circular cell carrying the day number in `{typography.body-sm}`. Default state is transparent fill, ink text.

**`date-picker-day-selected`** — Ink fill, white text, full circle (`{rounded.full}`). Range states between two selected days carry a `{colors.surface-soft}` lozenge background that connects them.

### Forms

**`text-input`** — White surface, 1px hairline outline, `{rounded.sm}` 8px radius, 56px height, 14×12px padding. Stacked label above (in `{typography.caption}` muted), placeholder text in `{typography.body-md}` muted. On focus, the border thickens to 2px ink and the border color flips to `{colors.ink}` — no glow, no ring.

### Footer

**`footer-light`** — White surface (matches the page canvas — Airbnb has no contrast footer), 48×80px padding. Three columns of link blocks (Support / Hosting / Airbnb), separated by generous 24px gutters. Each column heads with a `{typography.title-sm}` ink label and stacks `{component.footer-link}` rows in `{typography.body-sm}` ink.

**`legal-band`** — A bottom strip beneath the footer columns carrying the copyright line, language picker (globe icon + "English (US)" link), currency picker, and social icons (Facebook, X, Instagram). All text in muted `{colors.muted}` at `{typography.caption-sm}`.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 744px | Top nav collapses to logo + hamburger; product tabs hide behind a sheet; search bar collapses to a single tappable pill; property cards stack 1-up; city grid 1-column; listing detail collapses reservation card to a sticky bottom bar. |
| Tablet | 744–1128px | Top nav keeps product tabs but search bar narrows; property cards 2-up; city grid 2–3 column; reservation card stays sticky right-rail at narrower width. |
| Desktop | 1128–1440px | Full top nav with three product tabs centered; search bar at full pill width with all 3 segments visible; property cards 4-up; city grid 6-column; listing detail 2-column with reservation rail. |
| Wide | > 1440px | Content width caps at 1440px on listing/search pages and ~1280px on editorial; gutters absorb the rest. |

### Touch Targets
- Primary CTAs at minimum 48×48px (above WCAG AAA).
- Search orb is 48×48px circular — the most-tapped element on the page.
- Heart save button is 32×32px circular — borderline for AAA but compensated by a generous 12px padding inside the photo card.
- Date-picker day cells are 40×40px circular.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Top product tabs collapse into a hamburger sheet below 744px.
- Search bar's 3 segments collapse into a single-tap entry that opens a full-screen search overlay on mobile.
- Property and city-link grids drop column counts cleanly at each breakpoint — never reflow rows; always reduce columns.
- Reservation card on listing detail switches from sticky right-rail to a sticky bottom bar on mobile, carrying just the "Reserve" CTA + nightly price summary.

## Known Gaps

- **Hover state colors:** intentionally lightly documented.
- **Loading states / skeleton screens:** need to be defined based on the new palette.
- **Map view styling:** map markers should use the `{colors.secondary}` Emerald color for high visibility against map tiles.
- **Form input error states:** error text color (`{colors.error-text}`) is documented, but the full input outline + helper-text combination on validation needs standardizing.
